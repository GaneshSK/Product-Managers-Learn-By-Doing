## User Focus

A Product Manager is able to collaborate with user researchers and can sell or represent users internally. They understand the difference between user needs and desires of the user. They champion user research to focus on the totality of all users. They can prioritise and define approaches to understand the user story, guiding others in doing so. They can offer recommendations on the best tools and methods to be used.
