You have:

* Conducted competitor analysis or market scanning, and created actions or recommendations

* Described how a product or service vision contributes to the wider business goals
* Created or updated a product strategy, including a value proposition (e.g. business model canvas)
* Created or updated a product roadmap, including outcomes and performance goals
* Identified and analysed stakeholders
* Created and communicated stakeholder comms
* Represented or evangelised for your product or service outside of your department or organisation
