## Lifecycle Perspective
A Product Manager recognises when to move from one stage of a product lifecycle to another. They Ensure that the team is working towards the appropriate service standards for the relevant phase. They are able to manage the delivery of products or services at different phases.

You have:

* Supported or worked on a product moving between lifecycle phases (e.g. Alpha to Beta)
* Supported the implementation of a full change, from idea to release, to outcome
* Observed or supported pivoting a product (e.g. changing strategy to achieve the same vision)
