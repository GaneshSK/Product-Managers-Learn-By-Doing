## Understanding Constraints

A Product Manager can identify and understand constraints, and is able to communicate these and work within them. They are able to challenge the validity of constraints, and ensure standards are being met.

You have:

* Observed or supported a service standards assessment
* Described and understood the implications of the key constraints for your product or service (e.g. financial, legislative, political, resource etc)
