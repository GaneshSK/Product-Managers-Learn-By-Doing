A Product Manager ensures that the right actions are taken to investigate, resolve and anticipate problems. They co-ordinate the team to investigate problems, and implement solutions and preventative measures.

You have:

* Analysed a problem to create an insight that can be acted upon
* Negotiated across teams to reach a positive outcome for your product or service
